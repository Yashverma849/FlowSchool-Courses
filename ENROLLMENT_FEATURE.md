- **Enroll User**: Enroll a user in a free course
- **Get User Enrollments**: Retrieve all courses a user is enrolled in
- **Track Progress**: Update and retrieve enrollment progress
- **Complete Course**: Mark a course as completed

### 2. Enrollment Hook (`hooks/use-enrollment.js`)
- **useEnrollment()**: Custom React hook for managing enrollment state
- **checkEnrollment()**: Check if user is enrolled in a course
- **enrollInCourse()**: Enroll user in a course
- **getEnrollmentProgress()**: Get progress for a specific course
- **updateProgress()**: Update course progress
- **getUserEnrollments()**: Get all user enrollments
- **checkMultipleEnrollments()**: Check enrollment status for multiple courses

### 3. Course Cards Component (`components/course-cards.jsx`)
- **Enrollment Status**: Shows different button states based on enrollment
- **Auto-Enrollment**: Automatically enrolls users in free courses when "Start Learning" is clicked
- **Progress Display**: Shows progress for enrolled courses
- **Loading States**: Displays loading indicators during enrollment

### 4. Course Detail Page (`app/courses/[courseId]/page.jsx`)
- **Access Control**: Prevents access to courses user is not enrolled in
- **Enrollment Prompt**: Shows enrollment button for free courses
- **Progress Tracking**: Displays course progress
- **Access Denied**: Shows appropriate message for unauthorized access

### 5. My Learning Page (`components/my-learning-page.jsx`)
- **Enrolled Courses**: Displays all courses user is enrolled in
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows progress for each enrolled course
- **Filtering**: Filter courses by progress status
- **Statistics**: Shows learning statistics

## Database Schema

The enrollment feature uses the following database tables:

### `enrollments` Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.enrollments (
  id uuid NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid,
  course_id uuid,
  enrolled_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
  completed_at timestamp with time zone,
  progress_percentage integer DEFAULT 0,
  last_accessed_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
  CONSTRAINT enrollments_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id),
  CONSTRAINT enrollments_user_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES public.users(id)
);
```

### `courses` Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.courses (
  id uuid NOT NULL,
  title text NOT NULL,
  slug text NOT NULL,
  description text,
  thumbnail_url text,
  instructor_id uuid,
  duration_minutes integer,
  total_lessons integer,
  price numeric,
  level text,
  tags ARRAY,
  rating numeric,
  category_id uuid,
  is_free boolean,
  is_premium boolean,
  created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
  CONSTRAINT courses_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

## Usage Examples

### Enrolling in a Course
```javascript
import { useEnrollment } from '@/hooks/use-enrollment';

function CourseCard({ course }) {
  const { enrollInCourse } = useEnrollment();
  
  const handleEnroll = async () => {
    try {
      const result = await enrollInCourse(course.id);
      if (result.success) {
        // Navigate to course or show success message
      }
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle error
    }
  };
}
```

### Checking Enrollment Status
```javascript
import { useEnrollment } from '@/hooks/use-enrollment';

function CourseList({ courses }) {
  const { enrollments, checkMultipleEnrollments } = useEnrollment();
  
  useEffect(() => {
    if (courses.length > 0) {
      const courseIds = courses.map(course => course.id);
      checkMultipleEnrollments(courseIds);
    }
  }, [courses]);
}
```

## Security Features

1. **Authentication Required**: Users must be logged in to enroll
2. **Free Course Only**: Only free courses can be enrolled in directly
3. **Access Control**: Users cannot access course content without enrollment
4. **Progress Validation**: Progress updates are validated

## Error Handling

- **Network Errors**: Graceful handling of API failures
- **Authentication Errors**: Redirect to login when needed
- **Enrollment Errors**: User-friendly error messages
- **Access Denied**: Clear messaging for unauthorized access

## Future Enhancements

1. **Premium Course Enrollment**: Integration with payment system
2. **Course Completion Certificates**: Generate certificates for completed courses
3. **Learning Analytics**: Track detailed learning metrics
4. **Social Features**: Share progress with friends
5. **Reminder System**: Notify users about incomplete courses

## Testing

To test the enrollment feature:

1. **Create a free course** in the database with `is_free: true`
2. **Sign in as a user** through the authentication system
3. **Click "Start Learning"** on a free course card
4. **Verify enrollment** appears in the My Learning page
5. **Access course content** and verify progress tracking

## Dependencies

- **Supabase**: Database and authentication
- **React Hooks**: State management
- **Toast Notifications**: User feedback
- **Next.js**: Routing and server-side rendering
